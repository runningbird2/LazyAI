# Lazy AI

Lazy AI optimizes Minecraft’s AI calculations to improve performance with as minimal gameplay impact as possible.

## Overview
Lazy AI dynamically reduces the frequency and precision of mob AI calculations based on their distance from players. Mobs close to players behave normally, while those farther away update their goals, pathfinding, and other goals less often. This ensures smoother performance, especially in mob-heavy worlds.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Lazy AI bases its distance calculations of the simulation distance * *distance scaling* of your game

> [!WARNING]
> Lazy AI requires [fabric api](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)

### Lazy AI performance
**Using AI Optimization Type 'Dynamic' will dynamically switch between the three optimization modes based on TPS**
| Minimal  | Moderate | Agressive |

## Features
- **Distance-based AI scaling** | *Reduces AI updates for mobs that are far from players*
- **Pathfinding optimization** | *Simplifies A** *path calculations at long distances*
- **Reduced goal frequency** | *Look, wander, and tempt goals run less often when distant*
- **Configurable behavior** | *Easily balance performance and gameplay through a simple config accessible through [mod menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)*
- **Server-wide improvement** | *Decreases tick load even on servers*

## Settings
- **AI Optimization Type** | *This settings controls how aggressive the optimizations should be*
- **Distance Scaling** | *This setting controls what % range of your simulation distance is considered close and far range*
- **Distance Threshold Mode** | *Choose `SimulationScaled` (auto-derive distances from simulation distance) or `Fixed` (use exact block thresholds from config)*
- **Mob Tempting Delay** | *This setting controls how much delay animals have to being tempted by an item*
- **Disable Zombie Egg Stomping** | *This setting controls the prevention of zombies wanting to destroy turtle eggs*
### Available from version 1.3.2+
- **Never Slow Down Distant Mobs** | *This setting controls if distant mobs should never slow down. Enabling this reduces the mod's TPS-boosting effect on your game, but will fix large (multiply chunks large) mob farms slowing down production.*

### Fixed threshold configuration
When `DistanceThresholdMode` is `Fixed`, these values in `lazy-ai.json` define exactly where each tier starts:
- `FixedDistance_CloseBlocks` -> distance where **MediumRange** starts
- `FixedDistance_FarBlocks` -> distance where **FarRange** starts

Example (`>64` starts slowdown, `>96` enters far tier):
```json
{
  "DistanceThresholdMode": "Fixed",
  "FixedDistance_CloseBlocks": 64,
  "FixedDistance_FarBlocks": 96
}
```

## FAQ
### Can this mod increase my TPS?
Yes, this mod can improve your TPS.

### What modloader do I need?
You need Fabric

### I installed the mod, but didn't see as much difference?
The preview images are taken in a stress test situation. It can also be because your simulation distance or this mods *distance scaling* is set too high for your use case.

### Where is the config located?
.minecraft/config/lazy-ai.json

### Can this mod be used on a server?
Yes, you can use this mod on a server. The mod works on both the server and the client. Vanilla clients can join a server using LazyAI.

### Can this mod be used on a client?
Yes, you can use this mod on a client. The mod works on both the server and the client. Clients with LazyAI can join servers without LazyAI.
